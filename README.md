# 42 School Projects & Advanced Development

This repository contains implementations of various projects from the 42 School curriculum and advanced development projects, organized by their learning path.

## Curriculum Path

### 1. C Programming Fundamentals
- **42_Libft**: A personal C library implementing standard functions and utilities
- **42_GNL**: Get Next Line - A function that reads lines from file descriptors
- **42_printf**: Recreation of the printf function with various format specifiers

### 2. UNIX and Process Management
- **42_minitalk**: Client-server communication using UNIX signals
- **42minishell**: A simple shell implementation similar to bash
- **42_philosopher**: Implementation of the dining philosophers problem

### 3. Algorithms and Data Structures
- **42_push_swap**: Sorting algorithm implementation using two stacks
- **ft_containers**: Implementation of C++ STL containers (Vector, Map, Stack)

### 4. Graphics and Game Development
- **42_so_long**: A simple 2D game using MinilibX
- **42_Cub3d**: 3D raycasting game inspired by Wolfenstein 3D

### 5. Object-Oriented Programming
- **42_CPP_Module**: Series of C++ modules covering OOP concepts
- **ft_containers**: Advanced C++ programming with template metaprogramming

### 6. Network and System Administration
- **42_webserv**: HTTP/1.1 web server implementation
- **42_Inception**: System administration with Docker containers

### 7. Full-Stack Development
- **ft_transcendence**: Full-stack web application with real-time multiplayer game

### 8. Advanced Cloud & Distributed Systems
- **populmap**: Real-time population density visualization platform using microservices architecture
